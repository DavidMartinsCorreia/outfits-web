# 🧥 outfits-web: A Full-Stack Fashion Showcase

Welcome to `outfits-web` — my first complete full-stack project! I'm building this application to apply both frontend and backend technologies while developing a professional portfolio that reflects my skills as a full-stack developer.

This is a responsive fashion storefront powered by **Vue 3**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript** on the frontend, with backend features planned using **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**, and **Express.js**. It includes weekly outfit drops, category filters, user interactions, and a simulated checkout process — all working together to form a scalable full-stack architecture.

🧠 **Note:** While I'm confident with frontend development, I'm currently expanding my backend capabilities. MongoDB integration and API development are underway and will continue evolving as I solidify my experience with databases and server-side logic.
